Partner's description:
A while back, I lost a small silver ring that I used to wear every day. It wasn't flashy or particularly valuable in terms of money, but it had a lot of sentimental value to me. It was a gift from my mom, and it became a sort of good luck charm.

My interpretation:
A ring in front of a warm background, representing a good memory.
